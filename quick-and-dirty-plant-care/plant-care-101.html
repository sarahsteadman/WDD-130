                <h2 class="101-heading">Watering Frequency</h2>
                <p class="101-p">How often a plant needs to be watered will greatly impact how much attention you need to give it. If you want to go on vacation without finding a plant sitter, you’ll need to find a plant that can hold onto water. If you’re afraid you’ll forget about your plant if you leave it alone too long, look for something on the wispy side. What you’re really looking for is where the plant stores its water. Cacti and succulents hold water in their bulbous bodies like one big sponge. They can hold a lot of water this way, so they want to be watered infrequently. If a plant stores water in its leaves, they will be stiff and ridged. You’ll know it’s time to water them when the leaves get soft. Plants that have stalks, bulbs, or thick roots will also need a lot less water. (FYI it’s ok to carefully remove a plant from its pot in the store to check out what’s going on beneath the dirt.) If your plant doesn’t have any of these features to hold water, it’s going to require a lot of watering and probably a humidifier.</p>
                <h2 class="101-heading">Light Needs</h2>
                <p class="101-p">All plants need light, but usually houseplants require less light than their outdoor counterparts. In fact some plants will even get sunburned if put in a particularly bright environment. Plants that hold a lot of water in their leaves, stalks or bodies usually want a lot of sun. Plants that hold water under the dirt or don’t hold much water at all want less sun. The color of the plant can also tell you how much sun a plant wants. White plants or plants with bright colors will want bright bright light. Dark plants need little light.</p>
                <h2 class="101-heading">Dirt Choices</h2>
                <p class="101-p">You’ll want your dirt to compliment your watering schedule. Plants that want to be watered rarely will want dirt that dries out quickly. You can buy dirt that caters to this type of plant, or you can mix some up using bark, perlite, or sand. Strait soil will hold onto water like a sponge and is only going to be preferred by the most thirsty house plants. Most plants will be happy with a middle of the road mix of dirt and other stuff. I recommend having soil and perlite on hand so you can customize your soil if it isn't drying out quickly enough, or you are needing to water very frequently.            </p>
                <h2 class="101-heading">Pots</h2>
                <p class="101-p">The size of your plant will determine the size of your pot. Most plants want an inch or two of space around the root ball (or bulbs) to grow into and hold water. If a plant has roots coming out the top or bottom, it will need a larger pot. If a plant is in too small of a pot, the dirt may remain wet for too long and rot the roots. Too large and it won’t get enough water, and growth may be stunted. Plastic pots retain more water, terracotta pots will dry the dirt out faster, and ceramic pots are in the middle. And unless you know what you’re doing ALWAYS GET A POT WITH DRAINAGE HOLES! You need those holes to avoid overwatering and killing your plant.</p>
                <h2 class="101-heading">Pests</h2>
                <p class="101-p">There is nothing worse than having your home invaded by a swarm of plant loving insects! The most common insects are fungus gnats. They look like tiny flies that live in wet dirt. If you stop by Lowe’s plant section, you’re likely to see them flying around the over saturated potted plants. There are white flies that lay eggs underneath plant leaves, spider mites that make webs among the foliage, and powdery mildew that likes to hide in the cracks and crevices of plants. If you see signs of any of these, RUN! It’s not worth it.</p>
